                <div class="container-title">How to draw 6-point perspective</div>
                <div class="container-text">In this blogpost, we try to understand and construct a 6-point perspective. We begin by drawing a single vanishing point and iteratively adding vanishing points until we have reached the 6-point perspective. Spoiler: Drawing a 6-point perspective requires some rethinking of what a vanishing "point" really is.</div>
                
                <div class="container-text">In one-point perspective, lines converge to a single vanishing point. This vanishing point represents the point at which objects appear to vanish into the distance when viewed from a direct, head-on angle.</div>
                <div class="container-image" style="max-width: 220px;">
                    <img src="perspective-1-point.svg" alt="">
                </div>
                
                <div class="container-text">Two-point perspective introduces two vanishing points, each located on the horizon line. One vanishing point determines the convergence of lines on the left side of the scene, while the other does so for the right side. This technique is commonly used for depicting objects or scenes viewed from a corner or angled perspective.</div>
                <div class="container-image" style="max-width: 220px;">
                    <img src="perspective-2-point.svg" alt="">
                </div>
                
                <div class="container-text">Three-point perspective incorporates a third vanishing point. In addition to the two vanishing points on the horizon line, a third vanishing point is added either above or below the horizon line. This third point governs the convergence of vertical lines, adding depth to the scene and allows us to draw tall structures or scenes with significant vertical elements.</div>
                <div class="container-image" style="max-width: 220px;">
                    <img src="perspective-3-point.svg" alt="">
                </div>
                
                <div class="container-text">Four-point perspective expands the horizon by adding vanishing points positioned above and below the scene. These additional vanishing points further controls the convergence of lines in the vertical plane, which enables us to draw scenes with extreme foreshortening or spatial distortions.</div>
                <div class="container-image" style="max-width: 220px;">
                    <img src="perspective-4-point.svg" alt="">
                </div>
                
                <div class="container-text">In five-point perspective, one more vanishing point is introduced, extending the manipulation of the center. This additional points allow us to create scenes fantastical distortion.</div>
                <div class="container-image" style="max-width: 220px;">
                    <img src="perspective-5-point.svg" alt="">
                </div>
                
                <div class="container-text">The real challange beings when we try to conceptualize a six-point perspective. Here we need to apply a unique concept: the circular vanishing "point" [2]. Rather than a single point in space, the entire circumference of a circle serves as the vanishing point.</div>
                <div class="container-image" style="max-width: 400px;">
                    <img src="perspective-6-method.svg" alt="">
                </div>
                
                <div class="container-text">This circular vanishing point essentially allows draw everything that is in front of us with a 5-point perspective, as well as everything that is behind of us with a 5-point perspective.</div>
                <div class="container-image" style="max-width: 220px;">
                    <img src="perspective-6-point.svg" alt="">
                </div>
                <div class="container-text">Thus, drawing in a 6-point perspective is essentially like viewing the world as if we had eyes on the back of our head, and then projecting everthing we perceive onto a flat piece of paper. An alternative, and perhaps, easier way of drawing everything that is around us onto one piece of paper, would be to use both sides of the paper. Then we would "just" have to draw a 5-point perspective of everything that is front of us on one side of the paper, and everything that is behind of us onto the other side of that paper [1].</div>
